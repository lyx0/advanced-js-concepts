/*
 Functional programming is all about seperating concerns

 Seperating our code in seperate chunks so that everythings well organized and everything
 in our code concers itself with the bit it's good at

 Functions operate on well defined data structures like arrays or objects rather than belonging
 to that data structure

 Pure Functions:
    Seperation between data of a program and the behavior of a program
    Once something is created it cant be changed and we adhere to the principle of pure function
