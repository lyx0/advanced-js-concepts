// Context vs Scope

// Scope = what is the variable access of a function when 
// it is invoked what is in the variable environment

// Context = Object based, what is the value of the 'this' keyword, 
// which is a reference to what owns the current executing code

// Context is how is a function invoked (value of this keyword)
// Scope refers to the visibility of variables
