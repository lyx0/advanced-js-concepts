/*
 #1 Encapsulation
 Wrap code into boxes that are related to each so that these boxes can
 just interact with each other
 Makes code easier to maintain and reusable

 #2 Abstraction
 Hiding the complexity from the user, simpler interfaces.

 #3 Inheritance
 Avoid having to rewrite the same code, save memory space by having shared methods.
 #4 Polymorphism

 Many forms, ability to call the same method on different objects and each one responds
 in a different way.
